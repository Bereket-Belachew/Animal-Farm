## 🐓 What is Animal Farm?

Animal Farm is a **Java-based Livestock Management System** that helps farmers (or curious coders) keep track of their animals, tasks, and schedules — all in one place.

It’s like a digital barn, but with more logic and fewer smells.

## 🐐 Features

- 📋 **Livestock Page** – Track animals using efficient `HashMap` lookups (because linear search is so last century).
- 🧠 **Task Page** – Assign chores like “Feed the goats” or “Brush the cows”.
- 📅 **Schedule Page** – Keep track of when to milk, clean, feed, or vibe with the animals.
- 🔍 **Quick Lookup** – Animals are stored smartly for lightning-fast access. Your sheep won’t get lost in the crowd.
- 🚜 **Modular Code** – Written in Java using Maven, because even animals deserve good architecture.
